            <p>My maasum si ladki (don't get triggered)</p>
            <p>What else could be better than a love on a website built just for you</p>
            <p> I am not experienced enough in writing letters but hopefully that would change as I always wanted to write one (as you already know)</p>
            <p> I will write whatever comes to my mind now kyuki I am already tired of deleting the first line 6 times now</p>
            <p>Happy Birthday to the loveliest and most adorable girl i know (bit of a stretch but I am not good at complimenting otherwise)</p>
            <p> btw I am half drunk rn so I will be rechecking this tomorrow morning (apni roommates ko letter taadne mana karo)</p>
            <p>also according to my calculations you will be reading this at around 1am so soja and be ready tommorow at 6am (puri sabji khane chalenge)</p>
            <p> I tried adding emojis to this but apparently kaafi mehnat hai so we will leave that (aalsi hu maaf kardo)</p>
            <p>koustubh piche se "likhe jo khat tujhe" baja rha hai (har line ke baad brackets mei likhna zaroori nahi hai)</p>
            <p>letter ke bich mei i love you bol sakte hai kya? (i will save that for later)</p>
            <p>you wrote a poem for me so I wrote one as well (last mei add kar dunga abhi let me continue with the letter)</p>
            <p>August was already beautiful for me but now i have one more reason to love it </p>
            <p>There are endless possibilities of where I will be in years to come but all I want is you by my side in all those possibilities (kya hi line likha hu)</p>
            <p>aur kya likhu samajh nahi aa rha so here's the poem (don't mess up the rythm while reading)</p>

            <h2>Me & You</h2>
            <br>

            <p> I miss you just like a sunflower misses the sun on a rainy day</p>
            <p> I admire you just like a child admires to be like his father</p>
            <p> I believe you just like a theist who believes in gods</p>
            <p> I fell for you just like someone who would fall into the eyes of someone they love</p>
            <p> I care for you just like a painter cares for his painting before it's dry</p>
            <p> I want you just like the fish in an aquarium who wants the ocean</p>
            <p> I look at you just like a stargazer looks at the stars on a clear night</p>
            <p>I will protect you just like the roots that protects the trees from a landslide</p>
            <p> I trust you just like you trust me </p>
            <p>I love you just like I love you !!</p>
